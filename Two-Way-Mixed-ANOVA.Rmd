## The Effects of Low and High intensity Training on Cholesterol Concentration: A Randomized Controlled Trial

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Read in the RCT dataset into the "dat" data variable
dat <- read_csv("randomized_control_trial_cholesterol_data.csv")
```

The two-way mixed ANOVA compares the mean differences between groups
that have been split on two independent variables. The primary purpose
of a two-way mixed ANOVA is to understand if there is an interaction
between the two independent variables on the dependent variable. The
two-way mixed ANOVA is often used to determine whether there are
differences between independent groups over time such as in a
**randomized controlled trial** (RCT) where mulitple groups are tested a
number of times over a period of time (i.e., training vs control at pre
and post season). In ANOVA terminology, the independent variables are
normally called "factors." A two-way mixed ANOVA has one
between-subjects factor (i.e., group) and one within-subjects factor.

A between-subjects factor and a within-subjects factor are independent
variables, but whereas a between-subjects factor has independent groups
(e.g., gender: male/female), a within-subjects factor has related groups
(also known as repeated measures), such as time (e.g., pre- and
post-intervention). The primary purpose of carrying out a two-way mixed
ANOVA is to understand if there is a two-way interaction (i.e., an
interaction between the between-subjects and within-subjects factors).
This ascertains whether the effect of one of the factors is dependent on
the value of the other factor. For example, you might want to understand
if blood cholesterol concentration changes over time (e.g., 0, 3 and 6
months) if one embarks on an exercise-training programme of either low,
moderate or high intensity. Importantly, you would usually want to know
if blood cholesterol concentration changed differently over time
depending on which exercise-training programme was performed (e.g.,
either the low, moderate or high intensity exercise-training programme).
Understanding the latter requires the analysis of the two-way
interaction effect. In essence, the two-way mixed ANOVA allows you to
distinguish between the effects of different exercise-training
interventions over time.

**Scenario**: A researcher was interested in discovering whether the
intensity of an exercise-training programme, but with equal calorific
expenditure, had an effect on cholesterol concentration over a six-month
period. To answer this they implemented three different interventions.
In one intervention, participants did not change their current sedentary
lifestyle; this was the "control" intervention (group 0). In group 1,
participants underwent a low-intensity exercise-training programme that
expended 1000 kCal per week. Group 2 underwent a high-intensity
exercise-training programme that also expended 1000 kCal per week (but,
therefore, exercised for less total time). The participants in each
intervention were different and all interventions lasted six months.
Cholesterol concentration was measured three times: at the beginning,
midway and at the end of the interventions.

**Question**: What are the independent and dependent variables? What are
the research questions and the null hypotheses in this scenario?

**Variable Names**

You can check out the exact variable names:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
names(dat)
```

Let us prepare the data in the dataset for analysis. The original file
is set up in "wide" format, meaning the repeated measures of the
dependent variables are in their own respective columns. The dataset
will be converted to "long" format so that `time` is its own factor.
This converted dataset will be saved in the `dat_long` data vector:

```{r}
# define IVs as factors
dat <- within(dat,{
  ID <- factor(ID)
  group <- factor(group)
})

# convert from wide to long format
dat_long <- dat %>%
  gather(key = "time", value = "cho", pre, mid, post)

# define IVs as factors in the converted dataset
dat_long <- within(dat_long,{
  ID <- factor(ID)
  group <- factor(group)
  time <- factor(time)
})

# specify "pre" as the first test session
dat_long$time <- relevel(dat_long$time, "pre")

# this contains the data for the dependent variable
cho <- dat_long$cho
```

Next, we can calculate summary statistics for cholesterol by group and
time:

```{r}
sum <- dat_long %>%
  group_by(group, time) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = mean(cho),
    sd = sd(cho)
  )
sum
```

We can generate a plot of the dependent variable by group and time.

```{r}
# plot mean cholesterol values at each time point for each exercise group
cho.plot <- ggplot(sum, aes(x = time, y = mean, color=group, group=group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Cholesterol Concentration") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
cho.plot
```

From the plot above you can see that the three lines are not parallel
and some lines do in fact cross one another. On closer examination, it
would appear that participants in the control group (the red line)
maintained a similar, but declining, mean cholesterol concentration over
time. On the other hand, the low-intensity exercise-training group (the
green line) maintained a similar, but declining, mean cholesterol
concentration (a slight reduction after three months), but then a more
significant decline in mean cholesterol concentration from the mid to
post time point. The most pronounced effect on mean cholesterol
concentration was experienced with the high-intensity exercise-training
group (the blue line) with a large decline in mean cholesterol
concentration at both time points (i.e., midway and post intervention).
It would appear that the different groups have different patterns of
mean cholesterol concentration over time. As such, from these results,
it would appear that we might expect to find an interaction effect.

Despite the usefulness of profile plots in understanding your data, you
cannot determine an interaction effect from them because the profile
plot is based on the sample data and we are interested in determining
whether there is an interaction effect in the *population*. Therefore, a
formal statistical test is required to test for the presence of an
interaction effect (i.e., via statistical significance testing).

In this case, we will use the following code to perform a two-way mixed
ANOVA, which determines whether there is a two-way interaction between
the between- and within-subjects factors (i.e., a group\*time
interaction).

```{r}
# two-way ANOVA (factors are group and time)
anova <- aov(cho ~ group*time + Error(ID/time), dat_long)
summary(anova)
```

The row labeled by `group:time` shows whether or not there is a
significant interaction between the between- and within-subjects
factors. Since F(4, 84) = 107.8, *p* \< 0.001, it can be concluded that
there is a significant interaction between training and time on
cholesterol concentration. An APA formatted statements can be simply
worded as follows:

**There was a statistically significant interaction between the
intervention and time on cholesterol concentration, F(4, 84) = 107.77,
*p* \< .001**

The last part of the statement above, F(4, 84) = 107.77, p \< .001 has
the following meaning:

-   F - indicates that we are comparing to an *F*-distribution
-   4 in (4, 84) - degrees of freedom for the interaction term, which is
    calculated as (k-1) x (r-1) where k = number of groups and r =
    number of repeated tests
-   84 in (4, 84) - degrees of freedom of the within-subjects residuals
    (error), which is calculated as (n-1)\*(r-1) where n = sample size
-   107.77 - F-value (ratio of true variance/error variance)
-   p \< .001 - probability of obtaining the observed F-value given the
    null hypothesis is true.

**Question**: What can you conclude about the differences in cholesterol
between training groups across time?

## Procedure for a Significant Interaction

When you have a statistically significant interaction, reporting the
main effects can be misleading and you will want to determine the
difference between groups at each category of time and vice versa,
called simple main effects. You can run simple main effects using syntax
in R. Basically, you will run separate one-way ANOVAs and one-way
repeated measures ANOVAs to determine the main effects of training
`group` and `time`, respectively, on cholesterol concentration.

```{r}
# simple main effects ANOVAs (one-way ANOVA) between groups at each time point
# use WIDE formatted dataset
pre_av <- aov(pre ~ group, dat)
mid_av <- aov(mid ~ group, dat)
post_av <- aov(post ~ group, dat)

# simple main effects ANOVAs (RM-ANOVA) between time points for each group
# use LONG formatted dataset
control_av <- aov(cho ~ time + Error(ID/time), subset(dat_long, dat_long$group == "0"))
low_av <-  aov(cho ~ time + Error(ID/time), subset(dat_long, dat_long$group == "1"))
high_av <- aov(cho ~ time + Error(ID/time), subset(dat_long, dat_long$group == "2"))
```

Each of the above ANOVAs produces its own summary table.

**Main effect of training intervention**

Let's take a look at the results between training groups at each time
point.

First, for pre-intervention:

```{r}
summary(pre_av)
```

Next, for mid-intervention:

```{r}
summary(mid_av)
```

and post-intervention:

```{r}
summary(post_av)
```

You can see from the `group` row that there is a statistically
significant difference in cholesterol concentration between
interventions at both the mid- and post-intervention time points. You
could write these results as:

**There was a statistically significant difference in cholesterol
concentration between interventions at the mid-point of the intervention
(F(2, 42) = 5.91, *p* = .005) as well as at post-intevention (F(2, 42) =
13.56, *p* \< .001).**

Since there are more than two training groups, you can perform post-hoc
tests to determine pairwise differences between groups:

```{r}
TukeyHSD(mid_av)

TukeyHSD(post_av)
```

Notice that the post-hoc tests were only performed on the mid and
post-intervention data since the one-way ANOVAs above indicated
significant differences between groups at these two time points only
(i.e., not pre-intervention).

**Question**: Based on these post-hoc tests, between which two training
groups exhibited differences in cholesterol concentration at the
mid-point of the intervention? What about at the post-intervention
point?

**Main effect of time**

Now let's take a look at the changes in cholesterol over time for each
group.

First, for the control group (0):

```{r}
summary(control_av)
```

Next, for low-intensity group (1):

```{r}
summary(low_av)
```

and high-intensity group (2):

```{r}
summary(high_av)
```

We essentially performed three separate one-way repeated measures ANOVA,
one per group. They show that all three groups experienced statistically
significant changes in cholesterol across time. The results of the main
effect of time can then be summarized as:

**There was a statistically significant changes in cholesterol
concentration for the control group (F(2, 28) = 15.4, *p* \< .001),
low-intensity exercise group (F(2, 28) = 74.96, *p* \< .001), and
high-intensity group (F(2, 28) = 487.1, *p* \< .001).**

As there are three time points, a follow-up test is needed to determine
the time points between which the dependent variable changes for each
training group. With repeated measures, a Tukey post-hoc test cannot be
used since it assumes that independent groups are in each level of the
independent variable. Rather, we use a paired t-test adjusted for
multiple comparisons for each group:

```{r}
group0 <- subset(dat_long, dat_long$group == "0")
pairwise.t.test(group0$cho, group0$time, paired = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
```

This pairwise comparison indicates that for the control group, there was
not a statistically significant change in cholesterol from the pre- to
the mid-intervention time points (*p* = 0.270) but there were signficant
changes in cholesterol from pre to post-intervention (*p* = .002) and
from mid- to post-intervention (*p* = .005).

Now, let's take a look at changes in cholesterol in the low-intensity
group (1):

```{r}
group1 <- subset(dat_long, dat_long$group == "1")
pairwise.t.test(group1$cho, group1$time, paired = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
```

For the low-intensity group, you might report the results in APA format
as:

**For the low-intensity exercise group, cholesterol concentration was
not statistically significantly different between pre-intervention and
midway time points (M = 0.07, SE = 0.04 mmol/L, p = .277), but
cholesterol concentration was statistically significantly reduced at
post-intervention compared to pre-intervention (M = 0.40, SE = 0.04
mmol/L, p \< .001) and at post-intervention compared to mid-way (M =
0.33, SE = 0.03 mmol/L, p \< .001).**

Finally, let's take a look at changes in cholesterol in the
high-intensity group (2):

```{r}
group2 <- subset(dat_long, dat_long$group == "2")
pairwise.t.test(group2$cho, group2$time, paired = TRUE, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")
```

**Question**: What can you conclude about the changes in cholesterol in
the high-intensity group based on this pairwise comparison?

**Note**: If you do not have a statistically significant interaction,
you need to interpret the main effects for the between-subjects (for all
time points) and within-subjects (for all groups) factors. For example,
to determine the differences between training groups, a one-way ANOVA
can be performed on all measurements of the dependent variable,
regardless of time. Likewise, a repeated-measures ANOVA can be performed
across time points, regardless of training group. You would basically
run a one-way ANOVA and a repeated measures ANOVA to determine the
effects of the between- and within-subjects factors on the dependent
variable.

In conclusion, you can summarize these results as follows:

**There was a statistically significant interaction between the
intervention and time on cholesterol concentration (F(4, 84) = 107.77,
*p* \< .001). At the mid-point of the intervention, cholesterol
concentration was statistically significantly greater in the control
(5.99 +/- 0.60 mmol/l, *p* = .006) and in the low-intensity exercise
group (5.82 +/- 0.60 mmol/l, *p* = .044) compared to the high-intensity
exercise group (5.31 +/- 0.49 mmol/l). Cholesterol concentration in the
low-intensity exercise group was not statistically significantly lower
than the control group (*p* = .698). At post-intervention, cholesterol
concentration was statistically significantly greater in the control
(5.83 +/- 0.55 mmol/l, *p* \< .001) and in the low-intensity exercise
group (5.49 +/- 0.60 mmol/l, *p* = .004) compared to the high-intensity
exercise group (4.80 +/- 0.50 mmol/l). Cholesterol concentration in the
low-intensity exercise group was not statistically significantly lower
than the control group (*p* = .222).**

That was a short introduction to R and RStudio, but we will provide you
with more functions and a more complete sense of the language as the
course progresses. You might find the following tips and resources
helpful.

-   In this course we will be using the `dplyr` (for data wrangling) and
    `ggplot2` (for data visualization) extensively. If you are googling
    for R code, make sure to also include these package names in your
